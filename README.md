##Precision Oncology for diagnostic and treatment breast cancer

This repository contains all the scripts, practices, and reports developed during my master's research. It includes machine learning analyses on clinical data using Python, as well as MATLAB workflows for the construction of personalized metabolic models and phenotypic flux analysis.

Some notebooks will be updated progressively as the research advances.
